Introduction
The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters in a message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. This program allows you to easily encrypt and decrypt messages using this technique.

Features
Encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.
Decrypt messages that were encrypted using the Caesar Cipher.
User-friendly interface with options to choose between encryption and decryption.
Ability to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.
Installation
To run this program, you'll need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

cd caesar-cipher
Usage
To start the Caesar Cipher program, run the following command in your terminal:

python caesar_cipher.py
You'll see the following options in the program:

Encrypt message
Decrypt message
Exit
Example
Encrypt a message:

Enter the message you want to encrypt.
Enter the shift value (an integer).
Decrypt a message:

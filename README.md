# Caesar Cipher

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt text by providing a message and a shift value.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. In this program, users can encrypt a message by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. Similarly, they can decrypt a message by shifting the letters in the opposite direction.

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext using the Caesar Cipher method.
- Decrypts ciphertext back to the original message.
- Allows users to specify a custom shift value.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rootshadowcypher/caesar-cipher.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```

## Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher program, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

2. Input the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.

3. Provide the shift value.

4. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the message.
